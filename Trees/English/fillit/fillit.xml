As one of the admins of your Wolf group, have you ever encountered any problems for filling the game? Fortunately, Task  has solved this problem too. All you have to do is to join the channel below:
 https://t.me/joinchat/AAAAAFXQvS89k8VirGONPQ

Then make sure that the saved link of your group is valid in the robot. 
To check the group link, use the mygroup/ command. If the link is not valid or you want to change the link, use the command settslink/. 
Finally, at the join time of the game, reply the list of players starting with *#players* and send the fillit/ command. If you have done all these steps correctly, an invitation letter will be sent simultaneously with the fillit command in the channel mentioned above, so that the players can join your group to participate in the game if they want.
