*What is TSA?*


TSA stands for Task System Armor, which, as the name suggests, protects the task bot.

TSA rules are what you need to know about it, so that you can use the bot without any disturbance. 

*TSA Rules*

1- The bot calculates the number of messages containing profanity and rude words from admins.

2- Disturbance in the function and performance of the bot, by spamming commands, collusions in or out of the group , etc. 

3- If the admins of the bot cannot see themselves, it doesn't matter to insult them :) 

4- If you see a violation of the rules, please notify the bot admins (except the third rule).

Be careful, violation of the rules can result in individual or group restriction of the bot.

We will inform you if the rules are updated.

*Related Commands:*

With the /tsacheck command, you can check the group restrictions in the Task.
