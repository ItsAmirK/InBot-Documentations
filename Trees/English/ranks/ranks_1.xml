As mentioned in other documents about ranks,  by sending /myranks in *Task private chat*, the menu of your ranks will be opened and the number of keys you own will be shown, too.

*The use of each glass button in /myranks menu:* 

_ By touching *🎭 A Tricky Spy*, if you have 3 keys, you will get this rank.

_ By touching *🍩 I'll Show You Everything*, you will get this rank if you have one key.
 
_ By touching *📿 The Humble Guy*, if you have 2 keys, you will get this rank.

_ If you participate in Task's summer challenges and get the summer fruits rank, you can set your favorite fruit as the rank or change the selected fruit by touching *🍓Summer Fruits🍌* at anytime.

_ In the *👩‍🎓Student Rank👨‍🎓* menu, if you have earned the student rank by reading and scoring 15 articles from the /docs menu of the robot, you can select or change your emoji rank according to your gender and skin color from the following emojis:
👩🏻‍🎓👩🏼‍🎓👩🏽‍🎓👩🏾‍🎓👩🏿‍🎓
👨🏻‍🎓👨🏼‍🎓👨🏽‍🎓👨🏾‍🎓👨🏿‍🎓
🧑🏻‍🎓🧑🏼‍🎓🧑🏽‍🎓🧑🏾‍🎓🧑🏿‍🎓

_ By touching *🔨Remove a Rank*, you can delete the ranks you got by keys, but remember that your keys will not be returned to your account after it!

_ By touching *🎨Change Order*, you can change the order of your ranks and you can also choose which ranks will be displayed and which ranks will be hidden.
For this purpose, you can use the ⇡⇣ keys to move the ⌘ cursor up and down. When the cursor is in front of the desired rank, you can change the order of the rank by using the ⟰⟱ keys. Also, with the ⊂ ⊛ ⊃ key, you can hide or turn off that rank as long as you want. ⊷ is a sign that the rank is on and ⊶ is a sign that the rank is off.
After applying the changes, the changes are saved by pressing the セーブ  button.

If you get a new rank, send the following command to the private chat of Task to display your new rank:
/myranks showcount 20
