*Setting a public link:*

To register your group link as public, just send the /settslink command.

⚠️ Note that in order to set and confirm the link, Task must have access to invite members.

*Getting the group's link:*

To get the link of your group, send the command /mygroup in your group.

*Setting Private link:* 

To set the group link as private, send the following command:
/settslink nolink

If your group link is set as public, it will be used in all lists related to groups in Task bot. 

⚠️ Note that bot admins always have access to the group link (if needed) even if the link is private!
If you have not registered your group link, you cannot confirm your games.
