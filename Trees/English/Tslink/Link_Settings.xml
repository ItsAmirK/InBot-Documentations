In order to change the settings of the group link, the creator can use a command which is described below. 

* /linkoptions : *
This command can only be used by the creator of the group. 
After you set your group link in the Task bot, by using the /linkoptions command you access to two modes: 

The first mode is to make the link *private*. If you chose the link to be private, the link of your group will not be shown neither in the lists nor by using /mygroup  command. 
To activate this mode, just    change the button ❌ to ✅.

In the second mode, you can change your group link to *Join Reques* .
That means, if someone wants to join your group through the Task link, he/she should send a join request and this request can only be approved by the group admins so that he/she can join the group.
To activate this mode, just    change the button ❌ to ✅.

If your group is in private mode, you can only remove the group from this mode, but if your group is not private, you can change the group to *private* mode or a *request to join* mode.
