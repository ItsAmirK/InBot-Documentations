Every 12 hours, All registered players in Task can earn free points as a daily gift from the bot by using this command in the bot:
/DailyGift@TsWwPlus_Bot
/DailyGift

By sending the command, a multiple answer question is asked in the bot; after answering the question correctly, a dice will be thrown by the robot. Based on the number shown by the dice, between 100 to 600 points are added to the player's points in Task. 
If the dice shows number 6, another dice will be thrown as a reward. 
If you are lucky and the second dice shows 6 again, a dart is thrown by the bot. The maximum point, you can get by the dart is 300 points. 

So, as a daily gift by the TSWW you can collect from 100 to 1500 points twice a day.
