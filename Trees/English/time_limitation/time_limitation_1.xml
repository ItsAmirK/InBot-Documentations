  <btntext>Time Limitation</btntext>
  <value> 
A time limitation for playing has been added to Task to make the competition. The total net time of each player's games that are confirmed must be less than 10 hours a day. After this time, no points will be added to the player (and to his/her group)!

_ Note that total game time will be calculated, not the time you were killed/died in the game!

_ Playing in any group, whether registered in the group or not, will reduce your time.

In the  confirm message at the end of the game, the players whose time is over are shown with the 💤 emoji and the other players who have not reached the limitation are shown with the ⏳ emoji.

_ Note that in any case, the players' points will be displayed in the confirm message, but will not be applied for players with 💤.
