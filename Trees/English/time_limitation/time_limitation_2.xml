  <btntext>Time Limitation Commands</btntext>
  <value> 
Here are a list of commands that players can use about time limitation:

*_ /stack :*
By using this command, you can see your time details in a day.

*_ /push time :*
By using this command, you can save the time of your game in one day and use it later. (The maximum time for time saving is 12 hours.)

*_ /pop time :*
By using this command, you can use the capacity of the storage box and increase the time for playing in a day.

The two above  commands allow you to save your time and use it later when you can't (or don't want to) play.

- Example
/push 3:00
This command adds three hours to your saved time and subtracts from your daily time limitation for playing today. (Also, the remaining time from the previous day will be automatically added to the saved time).

/pop 00:30:30
This command adds thirty minutes and thirty seconds to your game time limit for the current day and subtracts from your storage box.
