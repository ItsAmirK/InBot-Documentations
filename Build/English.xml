      TSWW bot can now advertise for you...
      When the bot receives a message in private chat, it will chain the answer with some random
      advertisements. Therefore, automatically, no advertisements will be sent to groups or private
      chats.

      To add an advertisement in TSWW ads system or charge your ads expire time, you must process to
      the Ads Management Group (@TsWw_Ads).

      * /myads :* This command will show your saved ads on TSWW with some of its details.

    <btntext>Bot Activation </btntext>
    <value> To activate the task bot in your group, first you need to send an activation request. To
      do this, the bot must be admin with invite users permission; then send */active* command to
      your group. Remember that the command must be sent by the group owner.

      After sending the activation request wait for bot admins to come to your group and activate
      the bot.

      If you failed to send the activation request by any reason, you can join the support group for
      our help.

    <btntext>Cloudy Sky</btntext>
    <value> There may be sometimes that the TSWW bot is not responding to orders. The question is
      what to do when the bot is offline.

      The first thing to do is to demote Task from being an admin.
      Then, turn off the helper robots that automatically register the games because if the bot gets
      online they start confirming automatically and you may lose the points of the games while Task
      was offline.

      When task gets online again, promote the bot to admin once more and start confirming the
      previous games.

      ‚ö†Ô∏è Remember to use the /lgc command to be notified of the last registered game.
      Once a game is confirmed, you cannot confirm the previous games. So confirm the games one by
      one by order.

      Finally, we apologize for the cloudy sky that disappeared our moon and thank you for your
      patience. üåô

      *Saving Roles by Task*

      By using the ability of Task in saving roles, you can easily manage the game and remember the
      roles of the players in a game.

      To start, just reply the /new command on the first list of players after the game started.
      Even if you are in the middle of a game, you can reply the /clup command on the last list of
      players.

      Then, the bot will send a list of alive and dead players to receive roles. The first list will
      be updated as roles are added or players are dead; Task will pin the list if it has access to
      pin messages.

      Now players can save their roles by using /ts command and putting the desired text. for
      example:
      /ts ww
      This command will register the player's role as "werewolf üê∫". This command has a default
      description for each role and if you enter it instead of the role, it will show the
      corresponding role. For example, ww, wolf, werewolf, etc. will all be saved as werewolf üê∫.

      To update the list of dead players of the first list, reply the /stsup command on the last
      list of players of @werewolfbot. If you want Task to send the list of roles, you can use the
      /tsup command instead of /stsup.

      During the game, you can use the /list command to get the latest list of roles.

      At the end of the game, you can clear the list of players and the pinned message using the
      /clear command.

      In addition to the commands in the previous article, there are some other commands that help
      you in saving roles which are explained in the following:

      _ Get the player's saved role by replying the /role command on a player.

      _ Use the /tswho command to see which player has saved a certain role. Example
      /tswho wolf
      (There is no need to enter the exact letters of the role, for example, the word "wolf" is
      enough for the role of a werewolf)

      _ Remove the roles of players who have used inappropriate or promotional words: (only by
      admins)
      /noshit group ad

      _ Use the /eq command to get a list to balance the votes based on the last list of saved
      roles.

      _ Set a text or the name of a player for *voting* by the /slv command (by replying or in front
      of the command). This text can be received at any time using /glv command. (only by admins)

      A time limitation for playing has been added to Task to make the competition. The total net
      time of each player's games that are confirmed must be less than 10 hours a day. After this
      time, no points will be added to the player (and to his/her group)!

      _ Note that total game time will be calculated, not the time you were killed/died in the game!
      _ Playing in any group, whether registered in the group or not, will reduce your time.

      In the confirm message at the end of the game, the players whose time is over are shown with
      the üí§ emoji and the other players who have not reached the limitation are shown with the ‚è≥
      emoji.

    <btntext>Time Limitation Commands</btntext>
    <value>
      Here are a list of commands that players can use about time limitation:

      *_ /stack :*
      By using this command, you can see your time details in a day.

      *_ /push time :*
      By using this command, you can save the time of your game in one day and use it later. (The
      maximum time for time saving is 12 hours.)

      *_ /pop time :*
      By using this command, you can use the capacity of the storage box and increase the time for
      playing in a day.

      The two above commands allow you to save your time and use it later when you can't (or don't
      want to) play.

      - Example
      /push 3:00
      This command adds three hours to your saved time and subtracts from your daily time limitation
      for playing today. (Also, the remaining time from the previous day will be automatically added
      to the saved time).

      /pop 00:30:30
      This command adds thirty minutes and thirty seconds to your game time limit for the current
      day and subtracts from your storage box.

      *Getting the group's link:*

      To get the link of your group, send the command `/mygroup` in your group.

      *Setting Private link:*

      To set the group link as private, send the following command:
      `/settslink` nolink

      If your group link is set as public, it will be used in all lists related to groups in Task
      bot.

      ‚ö†Ô∏è Note that bot admins always have access to the group link (if needed) even if the link is

      In order to change the settings of the group link, the creator can use a command which is
      described below.

      * /linkoptions : *
      This command can only be used by the creator of the group.
      After you set your group link in the Task bot, by using the /linkoptions command you access to
      two modes:

      The first mode is to make the link *private*. If you chose the link to be private, the link of
      your group will not be shown neither in the lists nor by using /mygroup command.
      To activate this mode, just change the button ‚ùå to ‚úÖ.

      In the second mode, you can change your group link to *Join Reques* .
      That means, if someone wants to join your group through the Task link, he/she should send a
      join request and this request can only be approved by the group admins so that he/she can join
      the group.
      To activate this mode, just change the button ‚ùå to ‚úÖ.

      If your group is in private mode, you can only remove the group from this mode, but if your
      group is not private, you can change the group to *private* mode or a *request to join* mode.
